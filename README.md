# artix-dots
Dotfiles for my (current) Artix Linux install on my Thinkpad W530.

Tools I use:
- st
- dwm
- dmenu
- vifm
- mksh
- nvim ( I am learning GNU Emacs)


My setup uses suckless tools primarily, which by definition do not have dotfiles.

I am not learning Markdown currently, so I apologize in advance if all of these useless texts don't look great.
