Dotfiles for my (current) Linux install on my Thinkpad W530.

Tools I use:
- st
- ratpoison temporarily
- dmenu
- nnn
- mksh
- vim/nvim -> micro (and vis occasionally)

My setup uses suckless tools sometimes, which by definition do not have dotfiles.
You can find the suckless tools I use(d) in separate repos.

I am not learning Markdown currently, so I apologize in advance if all of these useless texts don't look great.
